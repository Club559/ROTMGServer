# EmpireWorld project #
This is the GitHub (private) repository for the EmpireWorld project from MMOEmpire.  
It contains the source code for the game launcher (currently only for RotMG), the RotMG private server (webserver and gameserver), and probably some other shit.  
  
### EmpireWorld launcher data server ###
Webserver-like structured. It accepts HTTP connections, and sends information about the latest client version, the game news (developer news), latest client download link, et cetera.  
[Server documentation]("EmpireWorld%20data%20server/readme.md")
### RotMG server emulator ###
Contains a webserver to handle the client's mainscreen's data (account information, servers, and leaderboards) and a gameserver to handle the player while ingame (worlds, enemies, other players, items, et cetera).  
[Web server documentation]("server/readme.md") | [Game server documentation]("wServer/readme.md")
